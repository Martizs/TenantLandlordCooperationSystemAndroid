# PrivatiSistema
The Android app part of my final years project for the Bachelors degree in IT Engineering. 
I tried to write all of the comments, variables, methods/functions in lithuanian, as it was required.  
It was a rushed job with sleepless nights as i was working full time while doing this. 

The main parts done by me are in the: \app\src\main
Where the res folder contains the design of the app and the other folder contains the actual Java code.
